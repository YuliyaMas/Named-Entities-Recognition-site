# Project for the Web, Database, and Localization course (Master in NLP)

## Description 
This project was implemented as the final task for the **Web, Databases, and Localization** course in the Master's in NLP program. It features a website designed for the NLP task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for texts in French, English, and Ukrainian. The NER models are powered by SpaCy.

The technology stack used includes: **HTML** for the main page, **PHP** for database interactions such as user registration, login, and recording NER results, **SQL** for managing database operations like registering new users and logging in, CSS for styling, **JavaScript** for user interaction with forms, and **Python** for the NER program.

The comments throughout the project are in French, targeting a French university audience.
